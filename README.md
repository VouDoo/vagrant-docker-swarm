# Vagrant projects

Various Vagrant projects are available in the [`projects`](./projects) directory.

To use a project, move to its directory and run `vagrant up`.

Please, do not be surprised if the projects do not work anymore, they are probably out of date.
I do not maintain them on a regular basis, I just use them when I need them.

List of projects:

| Name | Directory | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Prometheus | [prometheus](./projects/prometheus/) | Deploy a Prometheus server, a Grafana server to visualize metrics and another machine with Node exporter to export sample metrics |
| Ansible | [ansible](./projects/ansible/) | Deploy an Ansible controller |
| Docker Swarm | [docker_swarm](./projects/docker_swarm/) | Deploy a Docker Swarm manager and worker nodes |
| TeamSpeak | [teamspeak](./projects/teamspeak/) | Deploy a TeamSpeak server |
